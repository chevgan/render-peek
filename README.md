## Why render-peek?

React performance issues are often invisible. Components re-render silently, eating up CPU cycles and draining battery, often due to:
- ❌ New object references passed as props (e.g., `style={{}}` or inline functions).
- ❌ Parent updates that shouldn't affect the child.
- ❌ Broken `React.memo` comparisons.

**Console logs are noisy. React DevTools is powerful but heavy.**

**render-peek** gives you immediate, visual feedback right in your UI. If a component re-renders but its props haven't *actually* changed (deep equality), it flashes orange.

**It's like a Geiger counter for wasted renders.**

## Features

- 🔦 **Visual Feedback**: A subtle orange flash on unnecessary re-renders.
- 🧠 **Smart Comparison**: Uses deep equality to detect when props are *technically* new but *semantically* identical.
- 🙈 **Ignore Noise**: Easily ignore unstable props (like inline callbacks) that trigger false positives.
- 🪶 **Zero Config**: Just import and use. Styles are injected automatically.
- 📦 **Tiny**: < 2kb gzipped.

## Installation

```bash
npm install render-peek
# or
yarn add render-peek
# or
pnpm add render-peek
```

## Usage

### 1. Basic Usage

Wrap your component's props with `useRenderPeek`. If the component re-renders but props are unchanged, it will flash.

```tsx
import { useRenderPeek } from 'render-peek';

export const UserCard = (props) => {
  // 1. Hook into the render cycle
  const { className } = useRenderPeek(props);

  return (
    // 2. Apply the class to your root element
    <div className={`card ${className}`}>
      <h2>{props.name}</h2>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 2. Ignoring Unstable Props (Common Scenario)

Often you pass inline functions (callbacks) that are recreated on every render. These *are* changes, but you might not care about them for performance tuning. Use `ignoreKeys` to skip them.

```tsx
// Parent passes a new arrow function every time:
// <Button onClick={() => handleClick()} />

export const Button = (props) => {
  const { className } = useRenderPeek(props, {
    // Ignore 'onClick' so it doesn't trigger a "valid" change detection
    ignoreKeys: ['onClick'] 
  });

  // Now, if 'onClick' changes but other props are stable, 
  // render-peek will see it as an "unnecessary" render and FLASH.
  
  return <button className={className} {...props} />;
};
```

## How to Interpret the Flash

- **No Flash**: 
  - Either the component didn't render (good!).
  - Or it rendered because props *actually* changed (good!).
  
- **🟠 Orange Flash**: 
  - The component rendered, BUT the props (excluding ignored ones) are deeply equal to the previous render.
  - **Action**: This is a candidate for `React.memo`, `useMemo`, or fixing the parent's prop passing.

## Production Usage 🛡️

`render-peek` is designed as a **development tool**. You typically shouldn't ship it to production users.

To safely leave it in your codebase without affecting production, create a wrapper hook:

```tsx
// hooks/useRenderPeek.ts
import { useRenderPeek as useOriginalPeek } from 'render-peek';

export const useRenderPeek = (props: any, options?: any) => {
  // In production, return an empty object so it does nothing
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    return { className: '' };
  }
  
  return useOriginalPeek(props, options);
};
```

Now you can use your custom `useRenderPeek` everywhere. It will work in dev and be silent in prod.
